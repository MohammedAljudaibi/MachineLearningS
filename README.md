# Machine Learning Specialization
This repository contains my solutions, progress, and projects related to the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online, taught by Andrew Ng. The Specialization is an online program that covers various aspects of modern machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation and tuning, and a data-centric approach to performance improvement. This repository will have my solutions to the labs, projects and notes for the course

Please note that this is a personal repository for my own use and documentation of my progress in the course. I did not create or have any affiliation with the Machine Learning Specialization or any of the courses within it.

## Courses
The program consists of three courses:

1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
1. Advanced Learning Algorithms
1. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders and Reinforcement Learning

Each course includes several modules, and each module has its own set of lectures and assignments. I will organize my work according to the course structure to make it easier to navigate and follow.

## Tools and Technologies
The course emphasizes the use of Python programming language and the scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries for machine learning. Therefore, I will use Python for my assignments and projects and will also use Jupyter Notebooks to share my work.
